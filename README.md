# Pac-Man
Pac-Man game with vanilla Javascript


In this game Pac-Man moves around the grid while avoiding walls. By using the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unique characteristics to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest.

Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used:
- addEventListener()
- getElementById()
- querySelector()
- for Loop
- appendChild()
- createElement()
- push()
- if else statements
- classList
- switch case
- keyCode
- forEach()
- setTimeout
- Class
- constructor
- setInterval()
- removeEventListener
